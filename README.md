(The model originally planned to be a classification model of each ingredient and then predict the weight of the ingredient. From this, there can be a script to look up the macronutrients values on each ingredient per gram on an available dataset of each ingredient 
possible,  based on the model prediction of what ingredient present and its weight. However, the approach seems to be a bit complicated and not suited for the dataset, with several ingredient visually can't be distuingished.  
The model currently in the works now has been adjusted to predict the ratio of the nutrients per dish, and then total weight of the dish. The macronutrients can be calculated off this weight and the ratio)
